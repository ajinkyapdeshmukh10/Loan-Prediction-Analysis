# Project Title: Loan Prediction System for Banks

## Overview
::: {align="justify"}
This project delves into the development and implementation of a Loan Prediction System for banks, leveraging the power of machine learning to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of loan approval processes. The primary objective is to address the pivotal questions faced by lending institutions: evaluating the risk associated with borrowers and determining the appropriateness of extending loans to them. By constructing predictive models, this project aims to streamline decision-making, optimize resource utilization, and mitigate the financial risks inherent in the loan approval process.
