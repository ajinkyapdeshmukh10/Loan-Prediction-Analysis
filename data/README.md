## Data
::: {align="justify"}
The dataset used in this project consists of two CSV files: train and test. These files play a crucial role
in training the machine learning models and evaluating their performance. The train file is employed for
training the models, containing both the independent variables and the target variable. On the other hand,
the test file includes only the independent variables, and the modelâ€™s task is to predict the target variable
for this test data.

## Data Description

#Data Structure
The data is structured in rows and columns, with each row representing an individual loan application, and
each column representing a specific attribute or feature. The Loan Status variable in the train file serves
as the target variable that the machine learning models aim to predict.
The machine learning models will be trained on historical data from the train file, learning patterns and
relationships between various features and the loan approval outcome. Subsequently, these models will be
applied to the test file to predict the loan approval status for new, unseen data.
Understanding the nuances of each variable and the relationships within the dataset is essential for the
successful development and deployment of the loan prediction system.
